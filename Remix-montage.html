     <h1>Remix Montage</h1>

     <p id="artist statement">In this piece, I wanted to perceive that spreading around 
	 misinformation— or not giving enough information— could cause 
	 the community to become a little more toxic. A lot of people tend 
	 to not really put much research on certain topics, they’ll just 
	 believe what the media tells them and not bother checking for any 
	 proof. News outlets even hold back some information just so they 
	 could put someone in a bad light, which could lead to mobbing, and 
	 some fights breaking out. Only a few people look through the sources 
	 and research to try and assist the situation, But nowadays it has 
	 become harder and harder to believe what’s true or false. </p>
